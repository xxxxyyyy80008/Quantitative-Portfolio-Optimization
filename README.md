# Portfolio Optimization Notebooks

This repository contains Jupyter notebooks that explore various techniques for portfolio optimization, including mean-variance optimization, risk parity, and advanced methods.

## Notebooks Overview
1. **Mean-Variance Optimization** - Implementation of Harry Markowitz's theory.
2. **Risk Parity** - Allocation methods based on risk contribution.
3. **Sharpe Ratio Maximization** - Maximizing portfolio returns per unit of risk.
4. **Portfolio Simulation** - Monte Carlo simulations for portfolio performance.
5. **Advanced Optimization Techniques** - Includes methods like Black-Litterman and CVaR optimization.

## Prerequisites
- Python 3.8+
- Jupyter Lab or Notebook
